# Coffee Shop Customer Service Chatbot 🚀☕️

An AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance customer experiences in a coffee shop app. Leveraging the power of LLMs (Large Language models), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and RunPod's infrastructure, this chatbot can assist with taking orders, answering detailed menu queries, and providing personalized product recommendations—all within a React Native mobile app.

# 🎯 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent **agent-based chatbot** capable of:
- Managing real-time customer interactions, including processing orders.
- Providing detailed menu item information such as ingredients and allergens through a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**.
- Offering personalized product suggestions using a **market basket analysis recommendation engine**.
- Guiding customers through a smooth order process with clear and accurate order details.
- Filtering irrelevant or harmful queries using a Guard Agent to ensure safe and relevant conversations.

Key components include:
- Deploying a personal LLM with RunPod.
- Building an agent-based system featuring specialized agents like Order Taking, Details, and Guard agents.
- Setting up a vector database to store coffee shop menu and product information.
- Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver precise, context-driven responses.
- Developing and deploying a recommendation engine for product suggestions.
- Creating a React Native app that seamlessly integrates the chatbot into the customer experience.


## 🧠 Chatbot Agent Architecture

### 🤖 Key Agents in the System:
1. **Guard Agent:**
This agent acts as the first line of defense. It monitors all incoming user queries and ensures that only relevant and safe messages are processed by the other agents. It blocks inappropriate, harmful, or irrelevant queries, protecting the system and ensuring smooth conversations with users.
2. **Order Taking Agent:**
This agent is responsible for guiding customers through the order placement process. It uses chain-of-thought prompt engineering to simulate human-like reasoning, ensuring the order is accurately structured and all customer preferences are captured. It ensures that the chatbot gathers all necessary order details in a logical, step-by-step process, enhancing the reliability of the final order.
3. **Details Agent (RAG System):**
Powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, the Details Agent answers specific customer questions about the coffee shop, including menu details, ingredients, allergens, and other frequently asked questions. It retrieves relevant data stored in the vector database and combines it with language generation capabilities to provide clear and precise responses.
4. **Recommendation Agent:**
This agent handles personalized product recommendations by working with the market basket recommendation engine. Triggered by the Order Taking Agent, it analyzes the user's current order or preferences and suggests complementary items. This agent aims to boost upselling opportunities or help users discover new products they might like.
5. **Classification Agent:**
This is the decision-making agent. It classifies incoming user queries and determines which agent is best suited to handle the task. By categorizing user intents, it ensures that queries are routed efficiently, whether the user is asking for recommendations, placing an order, or inquiring about specific menu details.

### ⚙️ How the Agents Work Together
The agents work collaboratively in a pipeline architecture to process user inputs:

1. A customer query is received and first assessed by the Guard Agent.
2. If valid, the Classification Agent determines the intent behind the user query (e.g., placing an order, asking about a product, or requesting a recommendation).
3. The query is then forwarded to the appropriate agent:
    * The Order Taking Agent handles order-related queries.
        * Order Agent can forward the order to the recommendation agent to try and upsell the user near the end of their order.
    * The Details Agent fetches specific menu information.
    * The Recommendation Agent suggests complementary products.
